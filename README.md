# hello-world

##Well, have to start somewhere, right?

I'm getting into Angular after a lifetime coding COBOL then Java, first moving into Struts then Spring, now trying to catch up on all the cool kids' stuff...

Started with some simple examples on the web, moved on to some courses offered at work thru Skillsoft, quickly realized how dated all that was (AngularJS) and how fast things are moving.  

Signed up for "The Immersive Angular 2 Bundle" and working through

- Angular 2 From The Ground Up - Mirko Nasato... really good series of lectures with sample project code illustrating all the concepts

- Learn Angular 2 Development By Building 12 Apps - Eduonix, Brad Traversy... progression through 12 apps that show everything from basics of starter setup, to implementations with APIs, MongoDB, Express Server etc...

Some of the rest look redundant/basic, but may be good for refreshers later....

- Angular 2 Crash Course with Typescript
- Angular 2 Fundamentals for Web Developers
- Angular 2 Demystified
- Angular 2 with Typescript for Beginners: The Pragmatic Guide
